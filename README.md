# Wilbur Haratua
Hello! I'm an Information Systems student at Bina Nusantara University with a strong passion for web application testing and software quality assurance. I thrive on problem-solving, collaboration, and continuously expanding my skill set by exploring new technologies.
I have hands-on experience in Quality Assurance (QA), where I focus on ensuring software reliability and performance. I am highly adaptable, able to quickly grasp new concepts, and always eager to learn and grow in the ever-evolving tech industry.
Excited to take on new challenges and contribute to building high-quality software! ðŸš€
